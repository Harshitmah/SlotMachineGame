# Slot Machine Game in JavaScript & Node.js

A simple **Slot Machine** game built using **JavaScript** and **Node.js**. The game allows players to deposit money, place bets, spin the reels, and win based on matching symbols. It runs in the terminal using **prompt-sync** for user input.

## Features
- Deposit money before playing
- Choose the number of lines to bet on (1-3)
- Set a bet amount per line
- Spin the slot machine
- Check for winnings based on matching symbols
- Receive payouts for winning combinations
- Option to play again if balance remains

## How It Works
1. **Deposit Money**: The player enters an amount to start with.
2. **Choose Lines**: Select the number of paylines to bet on (1-3).
3. **Set Bet Amount**: Enter the amount to bet per line.
4. **Spin the Reels**: The game randomly generates a 3x3 grid with different symbols.
5. **Check Winnings**: If all symbols in a row match, the player wins based on predefined values.
6. **Update Balance**: Winnings are added to the balance.
7. **Play Again or Exit**: If the balance is above 0, the player can choose to continue or quit.
